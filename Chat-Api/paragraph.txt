Dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that lived during the Mesozoic Era, which spanned from about 252 to 66 million years ago. They were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the time, and their fossils are found on every continent. Dinosaurs ranged in size from the size of a chicken to the size of a bus. They were divided into two major groups: the Saurischia, which included theropods such as Tyrannosaurus rex, and the Ornithischia, which included plant-eaters such as Triceratops. Dinosaurs had a variety of adaptations, including horns, armor, and long necks. They were the first animals to walk on two legs, and some had feathers. Dinosaurs went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, likely due to a combination of factors, including an asteroid impact and climate change. Despite their extinction, dinosaurs continue to fascinate people today, and their fossils provide valuable information about the history of life on Earth.
